## Description

Objective: To understand the process of creating an ERC20 token and the key features of ERC20 tokens.


Instructions:

Research and write a brief summary of what an ERC20 token is, including its purpose and key features.

Choose a platform (such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Polygon) on which to create your ERC20 token.

Determine the specifications of your token, including its name, symbol, total supply, decimal places, and any other relevant features.

Write the smart contract for your ERC20 token. You can either write the code yourself if you have the necessary coding skills, or use a pre-written template and modify it to suit your needs.

Deploy your ERC20 token on the chosen platform.

Test your ERC20 token by sending and receiving transactions and verifying that the token behaves as expected.

Write a report summarizing the key features of your ERC20 token, the process of creating and deploying it, and any lessons learned or challenges faced during the process.
