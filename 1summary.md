### Step 1 : Research and write a brief summary of what an ERC20 token is, including its purpose and key features.

On the Ethereum network, a token can represent almost anything, including financial assets like a company share, in-game character skills, reputation points, or even fiat currency like Ksh. ERC20 is a fungible token standard that allows developers to create token applications that are interoperable with other products and services. Fungible tokens are identical in type and value to other tokens, ensuring network consistency and making them easily exchangeable.

The ERC20 standard defines a set of rules and functions that an Ethereum-based token must follow in order to be considered an ERC20 token.

Some of the key features of ERC20 tokens are as follows:

- Fungibility: Because each token is identical to every other token of the same type, they can be exchanged and used interchangeably.

- ERC20 tokens are easily transferable between Ethereum addresses, making them a convenient and efficient means of payment.

- Interoperability: Because ERC20 tokens adhere to a set of standardized rules and functions, they are easily integrated with other Ethereum-based applications and services.

- Decentralization: ERC20 tokens are decentralized, which means they are managed by the Ethereum network rather than a central authority.

- get the current token balance of an account
- get the total supply of the token available on the network
- approve whether an amount of token from an account can be spent by a third-party account
